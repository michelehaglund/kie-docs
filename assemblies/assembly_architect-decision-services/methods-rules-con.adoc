= Methods versus rules

Rule conditions are often configured using Java methods, which can become difficult to configure and troubleshoot for complex business rule definitions.

Methods are useful and easy to define for simple `if` rule conditions as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
public void helloWorld(Person person) {
    if ( person.getName().equals( "Chuck" ) ) {
        System.out.println( "Hello Chuck" );
    }
}
----

{PRODUCT} provides a user interface that simplifies the process of defining rules that are comprised of complex decision conditions within a decision process. See {URL_GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}[_{GETTING_STARTED_DECISION_SERVICE}_] to familiarize yourself with the UI-based guided rules designer in {CENTRAL}.
