<title>About Red Hat Decision Manager</title>
<simpara>Red Hat Decision Manager is an open source decision management platform that combines business rules management, complex event processing, Decision Model &amp; Notation (DMN) execution, and Business Optimizer for solving planning problems. It automates business decisions and makes that logic available to the entire business.</simpara>
<simpara>Business assets such as rules, decision tables, and DMN models are stored in a central repository. This ensures consistency, transparency, and the ability to audit across the business. Business users can modify business logic without requiring assistance from IT personnel.</simpara>
<simpara>Red Hat Decision Manager is fully supported on OpenShift and can be installed on various platforms.</simpara>

<title>New Task List and Task Administration perspectives</title>
<simpara>The former Task List perspective has been divided into the Task List and Task Administration perspectives. The Task List perspective is used by task operators to work with their assigned (or potentially assigned) tasks. The Task Administration perspective is used by administrators to manage tasks assigned to other users. This perspective is only available for users with admin or process-admin roles. It is similar to the Admin filter tab on the former Task List perspective.</simpara>

<simpara>While running a process instance or a job, the system now detects and stores execution errors such as exceptions after the maximum number of retries has been exceeded. If an error occurs, the system generates an event that contains the following data:</simpara>
<informaltable frame="all" rowsep="1" colsep="1">

<section xml:id="process_api_and_task_administration_api" remap="_process_api_and_task_administration_api">
<title>Process API and task administration API</title>
<simpara>A process administration API and task administration API have been introduced to simplify some of the more complex administrator use cases.
You can use the process administration API to do the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Retrieve all process definition nodes</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Cancel node instances</simpara>

<section xml:id="advanced_task_routing" remap="_advanced_task_routing">
<title>Advanced task routing</title>
<simpara>When tasks are assigned to a group of users, you can use pluggable task assignment strategies to automatically assign tasks to a suitable individual immediately. This enables more efficient task allocation, based on all properties associated with the task. For example, potential owners and task priority but also task data that includes information such as geography, required skills, and so on. You can use business rules to define the assignment logic, making it easy to customize this to your needs.</simpara>

<section xml:id="process_execution_server" remap="_process_execution_server">
<title>Process execution server</title>
<simpara>The process execution server (also known as kie-server) has been extended to support core engine features and offers a remote API for these operations. In addition the following architectural changes were introduced.</simpara>
<section xml:id="separate_business_central_from_execution_server" remap="_separate_business_central_from_execution_server">
<title>Separate Business Central from execution server</title>
<simpara>Business Central now delegates all of its requests to the execution server. The main advantage is that Business Central can now be used to monitor any set of execution servers. By linking the execution server to Business Central, the process and task monitoring UIs in Business Central can now connect to this execution server and show all relevant information. When multiple independent execution servers are used, you can either connect to a specific one or use the smart router to aggregate information across multiple servers.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="smart_router" remap="_smart_router">
<title>Smart router</title>
<simpara>The smart router (also known as kie-server-router) can be used as a proxy to help manage multiple independent process execution servers.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="aliases" remap="_aliases">
<title>Aliases</title>
<simpara>You can now use aliases instead of container IDs in the remote REST APIs of the execution server. For more information, see the "Editing container aliases through Business Central" section of the <emphasis>Red Hat Decision Manager User Guide</emphasis>.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="business_central_monitoring_web_application" remap="_business_central_monitoring_web_application">
<title>Business Central Monitoring web application</title>
<simpara>This release includes a new distribution <literal>war</literal> file that enables you to build custom cloud images. Use the Business Central Monitoring web application with Decision Server instances to manage containers, process instances, tasks, dashboards, and other runtime capabilities in the cloud. Unlike the standard Business Central distribution, no authoring capabilities are available.</simpara>
<simpara>NOTE:
For on-premise deployments, use the standard Business Central <literal>war</literal> file.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="work_item_archetype" remap="_work_item_archetype">
<title>Work Item archetype</title>
<simpara>To help users build custom service tasks (work items), Red Hat Decision Manager comes with the Work Item archetype that generates the majority of items required to build a custom service task.  The archetype includes the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>A Work Item Definition (WID) file</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The Work Item Handler implementation class</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The Work Item Handler test class</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The Maven assembly (zip) packages everything at build time so it can be consumed by the Service Repository and therefore be used from within the Web Designer.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="kie_server_maven_plugins" remap="_kie_server_maven_plugins">
<title>KIE Server Maven plugins</title>
<simpara>KIE Server has been enhanced with additional Maven plugins that enable interaction with the KIE Server and KIE Controller REST API directly from within a build. This interaction facilitates easier integration with CI/CD pipelines when building KJars so they can be directly deployed to the execution environment (both managed and unmanaged KIE Servers).</simpara>

</section>
<section xml:id="business_resource_planner" remap="_business_resource_planner">
<title>Business Resource Planner</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Multi-threaded partitioned search is available. Business Resource Planner now has out-of-the box support for solving a single data set by partitioning across multiple threads. This enhancement makes use of multiple CPU cores for a single problem. Partitioned search can implement geo-fencing for Vehicle Routing use cases.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The Solution interface is deprecated. Your solution class requires only the <literal>@PlanningSolution</literal> annotation.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>You no longer need to define the score type in the solver configuration. Business Resource Planner now determines it automatically from the domain model.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The Business Resource Planner Solver editor screen now supports adding all termination types, including composite termination. The phase configuration section enables you to tweak Construction Heuristic settings and select the local search algorithm to optimize your planning problem.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Examples are now part of Business Central and they work offline as well. Leverage tag-based filtering to quickly access projects from the field you are interested in.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The Business Resource Planner domain editor can now specify a planning entity difficulty. Navigate through the object hierarchy and define the sorting attributes. Several construction heuristic algorithms use this information to construct a better initial solution.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The Business Resource Planner execution server now supports real-time planning.</simpara>
