// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business analyst or rules developer, you can use {CENTRAL} in {PRODUCT} to design a variety of decision services. In this tutorial, you will create and test a driver's license suspension model by creating a data model that is made up of data objects with data fields, such as Violation Date, Fine Amount, and so on.

.Prerequisites
* Installed {EAP_LONG} 7.1.0. For details, see  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.1/html-single/installation_guide/[_Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.1.0 Installation Guide_].
* Installed {PRODUCT}. For further information, see the {INSTALLATION_GUIDE}.
* {PRODUCT} is running and you can log in to {CENTRAL} with the `admin` role. For further information, see the Installing Decision Manager on premise guide.
