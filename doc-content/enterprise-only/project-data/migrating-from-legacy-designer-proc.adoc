= Migrating projects from the deprecated legacy process designer

The legacy process designer in {CENTRAL} is deprecated in {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION_LONG}. It will be removed in a future {PRODUCT} release. The legacy process designer will not receive any new enhancements or features. Existing users of the legacy process designer should start migrating projects to the new designer and all new projects should be created using the new process designer.

Only business processes that contain nodes types that are supported in the new designer can be migrated. More node types will be supported in future versions of {PRODUCT}.

[NOTE]
====
The legacy process designer is disabled by default in {CENTRAL}. To enable the legacy process designer in {CENTRAL}, in the upper-right corner of the window click *Settings* -> *Roles*, select a role from the left panel, click *Editors -> Select Editor -> (Legacy) Process Designer -> Read*, and then click *Save* to save the changes.
====

.Prerequisites
* You have an existing project that was created in the legacy process designer.

.Procedure
. In {CENTRAL}, click *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
. Click on the project you want to migrate, for example *{PROJECT}*.
. Click *Ok* to open the project's asset list.
. Click on the project's *Business Process* asset to open it in the legacy process designer.
. Click *Migrate* -> *Migrate Diagram*. If you have made changes to the diagram prior to migrating, select *Yes* or *No* to confirm whether or not to save your changes.

If the migration is successful, the business process opens in the new process designer and the business process name's extension changes from `*.bpmn2` to `*.bpmn`.

If the migration is unsuccessful due to an unsupported node type, {Central} will provide the following error message:
