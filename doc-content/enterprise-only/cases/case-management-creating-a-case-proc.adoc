= Creating a new IT Orders case project

A case project is a type of project in {CENTRAL} that is configured for case management. When you create a new case project, the following configurations are set automatically in {CENTRAL}:

* Runtime strategy is set to `Per Case` in order to correctly initialize the {KIE_SERVER}.
* Case file and documents marshallers are configured. These marshallers serialize case file data and attached documents across the entire case.
* `WorkDefinition.wid` files are created in the project and its packages to ensure case-related nodes such as `Milestone` and `Cases` are available in the case definition design palette.

.Procedure
. Log in to {CENTRAL} and go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Projects*.
+

*Tip*: {CENTRAL} provides a default space called *MySpace*, as shown in the following image. You can use the default space to create and test example projects.
