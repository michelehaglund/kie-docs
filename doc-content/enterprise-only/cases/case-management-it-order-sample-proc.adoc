= Importing and reviewing the IT_Orders sample project

Before you create your own project, import and review the existing *IT_Orders* sample project in {CENTRAL}. Familiarize yourself with the assets that comprise the project:

* Data Objects
* Forms
* Business Processes
* Business Processes (legacy)
* Work Item Definitions

During the process of creating your own project, you can refer back to the sample project for assistance if needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The business process application example includes features that are Technology Preview only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and are not recommended for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about Red Hat Technology Preview support, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
