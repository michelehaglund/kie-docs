= Process definitions
A Process definition is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0-compliant file that serves as container for a process and its BPMN diagram. The process definition shows all of the available information about the business process. For example, you can check to see if there is a subprocess associated with it, or how many users and groups are participating in the selected definition.

After you build and deploy your project containing your business processes you can view the process definitions by logging in to {PRODUCT} and clicking *Menu* -> *Manage* -> *Process Definitions*.
