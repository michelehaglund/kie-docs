<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager versioning</title>
<simpara>Red Hat Process Automation Manager versions are designated with a numerical <literal>Major.Minor.Patch</literal> format, such as <literal>7.5.1</literal>. In this example, the major release is <literal>7.x.x</literal>, the minor release is <literal>7.5.x</literal>, and the patch release is <literal>7.5.1</literal>. Major releases often require data migration, while minor release upgrades and patch updates are typically managed with update tools provided with the Red Hat Process Automation Manager release artifacts.</simpara>
<simpara>The following are the general types of releases for Red Hat Process Automation Manager:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Major release migrations</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Major releases of Red Hat Process Automation Manager include substantial enhancements, security updates, bug fixes, and possibly redesigned features and functions. Data migration is typically required when an application is moved from one major release to another major release, such as from Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.x to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.0. Automated migration tools are often provided with new major versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate migration, but some manual effort is likely required for certain data and configurations. The supported migration paths are specified in product announcements and documentation.</simpara>
<simpara>For example migration instructions, see
<link xlink:href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_process_automation_manager/7.0/html/migrating_from_red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite_6.4_to_red_hat_process_automation_manager_7.0/"><emphasis>Migrating from Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4 to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.0</emphasis></link>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Minor release upgrades</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Minor releases of Red Hat Process Automation Manager include enhancements, security updates, and bug fixes. Data migration may be required when an application is moved from one minor release to another minor release, such as from Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.5.x to 7.6. Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate updating certain components of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless Process Automation Manager controller. Other Red Hat Process Automation Manager artifacts, such as the decision engine and standalone Business Central, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must re-install them to apply the update.</simpara>
<simpara>Before you upgrade to a new minor release, apply the latest patch update to your current version of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to ensure that the minor release upgrade is successful.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Patch updates</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Patch updates of Red Hat Process Automation Manager include the latest security updates and bug fixes. Scheduled patch updates contain all previously released patch updates for that minor version of the product, so you do not need to apply each patch update incrementally in order to apply the latest update. For example, you can update Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.5.0 or 7.5.1 to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.5.2. However, for optimal Red Hat Process Automation Manager performance, apply product updates as they become available. Occasionally, unscheduled patch updates may be released outside the normal update cycle of the existing product. These may include security or other updates provided by Red Hat Global Support Services (GSS) to fix specific issues, and may not be cumulative updates.</simpara>
<simpara>Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate updating certain components of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless Process Automation Manager controller. Other Red Hat Process Automation Manager artifacts, such as the decision engine and standalone Business Central, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must re-install them to apply the update.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>To ensure optimal transition between releases and to keep your Red Hat Process Automation Manager distribution current with the latest enhancements and fixes, apply new product releases and updates to Red Hat Process Automation Manager as they become available in the Red Hat Customer Portal. Consider also enabling product notifications in the Red Hat Customer Portal.</simpara>

<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager components</title>
<simpara>Red Hat Process Automation Manager is made up of Business Central and KIE Server.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Business Central is the graphical user interface where you create and manage business rules. You can install Business Central in a Red Hat JBoss EAP instance or on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OpenShift).</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central is also available as a standalone JAR file. You can use the Business Central standalone JAR file to run Business Central without deploying it to an application server.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>KIE Server is the server where rules and other artifacts are executed. It is used to instantiate and execute rules and solve planning problems. You can install KIE Server in a Red Hat JBoss EAP instance, in a Red Hat JBoss EAP cluster, on OpenShift, in an Oracle WebLogic server instance, in an IBM WebSphere Application Server instance, or as a part of Spring Boot application.</simpara>
<simpara>You can configure KIE Server to run in managed or unmanaged mode. If KIE Server is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain KIE containers (deployment units). A KIE container is a specific version of a project. If KIE Server is managed, the Process Automation Manager controller manages the KIE Server configuration and you interact with the Process Automation Manager controller to create and maintain KIE containers.</simpara>
<simpara>The Process Automation Manager controller is integrated with Business Central. If you install Business Central on Red Hat JBoss EAP, use the Execution Server page to create and maintain KIE containers. However, if you do not install Business Central, you can install the headless Process Automation Manager controller and use the REST API or the KIE Server Java Client API to interact with it.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Red Hat Business Optimizer is integrated in Business Central and KIE Server. It is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine that optimizes planning problems. Red Hat Business Optimizer helps Java programmers solve planning problems efficiently, and it combines optimization heuristics and metaheuristics with efficient score calculations.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="supported-repos-con_planning">
<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager supported repositories</title>
<simpara>You can use Git repositories and Apache Maven with Red Hat Process Automation Manager.</simpara>
<section xml:id="git_repositories" remap="_git_repositories">
<title>Git repositories</title>
<simpara>Git repositories are used internally within Business Central to store all processes, rules, and other artifacts that are created in the authoring environment. Git is a distributed version control system. It implements revisions as commit objects. When you commit your changes into a repository, a new commit object in the Git repository is created. When you create a project in Business Central, it is added to the Git repository that is connected to Business Central.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have projects in other Git repositories, you can import them into Business Central spaces. You can use Git hooks to synchronize the internal Git repositories with external repositories.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="apache_maven" remap="_apache_maven">
<title>Apache Maven</title>
<simpara><link xlink:href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</link> is a distributed build automation tool used in Java application development to build and manage software projects. You can use Maven to build, publish, and deploy your Red Hat Process Automation Manager projects. Maven provides the following benefits:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The build process is easy and a uniform build system is implemented across projects.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>All of the required JAR files for a project are made available at compile time.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A proper project structure is configured.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Dependencies and versions are well managed.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>There is no need for additional build processing because Maven builds output into a number of predefined types, such as JAR and WAR.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Maven uses repositories to store Java libraries, plug-ins, and other build artifacts. These repositories can be local or remote. Red Hat Process Automation Manager maintains local and remote maven repositories that you can add to your project for accessing the rules, processes, events, and other project dependencies. When building projects and archetypes, Maven dynamically retrieves Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from local or remote repositories. Doing this promotes sharing and reuse of dependencies across projects.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="installation-options-ref_planning">
<title>Installation environment options for Red Hat Process Automation Manager</title>
<simpara>With Red Hat Process Automation Manager, you can set up a development environment to develop business applications, a runtime environment to run those applications to support decisions, or both.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Development environment</emphasis>: Typically consists of one Business Central installation and at least one KIE Server installation. You can use Business Central to design decisions and other artifacts, and you can use KIE Server to execute and test the artifacts that you created.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Runtime environment</emphasis>: Consists of one or more KIE Server instances with or without Business Central. Business Central has an embedded Process Automation Manager controller. If you install Business Central, use the <emphasis role="strong">Menu</emphasis> → <emphasis role="strong">Deploy</emphasis> → <emphasis role="strong">Execution servers</emphasis> page to create and maintain containers. If you want to automate KIE Server management without Business Central, you can use the headless Process Automation Manager controller.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You can also cluster both development and runtime environments. A clustered development or runtime environment consists of a unified group or cluster of two or more servers. The primary benefit of clustering Red Hat Process Automation Manager development environments is high availability and enhanced collaboration, while the primary benefit of clustering Red Hat Process Automation Manager runtime environments is high availability and load balancing. High availability decreases the chance of data loss when a single server fails. When a server fails, another server fills the gap by providing a copy of the data that was on the failed server. When the failed server comes online again, it resumes its place in the cluster.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Clustering of the runtime environment is currently supported on Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.3
and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
only.</simpara>
</note>
</chapter>
<chapter xml:id="roles-users-con_planning">
<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager roles and users</title>
<simpara>To access Business Central or KIE Server, you must create users and assign them appropriate roles before the servers are started. You can create users and roles when you install Business Central or KIE Server.</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central and KIE Server use the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login module to authenticate users. If both Business Central and KIE Server are running on a single instance, then they share the same JAAS subject and security domain. Therefore, a user who is authenticated for Business Central can also access KIE Server.</simpara>
<simpara>However, if Business Central and KIE Server are running on different instances, then the JAAS login module is triggered for both individually. Therefore, a user who is authenticated for Business Central must be authenticated separately to access KIE Server.  For example, if a user who is authenticated on Business Central but not authenticated on KIE Server tries to view or manage process definitions in Business Central, a 401 error is logged in the log file and the <literal>Invalid credentials to load data from remote server. Contact your system administrator.</literal> message appears in Business Central.</simpara>
<simpara>This section describes Red Hat Process Automation Manager user roles.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>admin</literal>,  <literal>analyst</literal>,
<literal>developer</literal>, <literal>manager</literal>, <literal>process-admin</literal>, <literal>user</literal>,
 and <literal>rest-all</literal> roles are reserved for Business Central. The <literal>kie-server</literal> role is reserved for KIE Server. For this reason, the available roles can differ depending on whether Business Central, KIE Server, or both are installed.</simpara>

<title>About Red Hat Process Automation Manager</title>
<simpara>Red Hat Process Automation Manager is the Red Hat middleware platform for creating business automation applications and microservices. It enables enterprise business and IT users to document, simulate, manage, automate, and monitor business processes and policies. It is designed to empower business and IT users to collaborate more effectively, so business applications can be changed easily and quickly.</simpara>
<simpara>Red Hat Process Automation Manager is made up of Business Central and KIE Server.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>KIE Server is the server where rules and other artifacts are executed. It is used to instantiate and execute rules and solve planning problems. KIE Server provides the runtime environment for business assets and accesses the data stored in the assets repository (knowledge store).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Business Central</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Business Central is the graphical user interface where you create and manage business rules that KIE Server executes. It enables you to perform the following tasks:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Create, manage, and edit your rules, processes, and related assets.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Manage connected KIE Server instances and their KIE containers (deployment units).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Execute runtime operations against processes and tasks in KIE Server instances connected to Business Central.</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central is also available as a standalone JAR file. You can use the Business Central standalone JAR file to run Business Central without needing to deploy it to an application server.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (Red Hat JBoss EAP) 7.3 is a certified implementation of the Java Enterprise Edition 8 (Java EE 8) full and web profile specifications. Red Hat JBoss EAP provides preconfigured options for features such as high availability, clustering, messaging, and distributed caching. It also enables users to write, deploy, and run applications using the various APIs and services that Red Hat JBoss EAP provides.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="roles-users-con_install-on-eap">
<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager roles and users</title>
<simpara>To access Business Central or KIE Server, you must create users and assign them appropriate roles before the servers are started. You can create users and roles when you install Business Central or KIE Server.</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central and KIE Server use the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login module to authenticate users. If both Business Central and KIE Server are running on a single instance, then they share the same JAAS subject and security domain. Therefore, a user who is authenticated for Business Central can also access KIE Server.</simpara>
<simpara>However, if Business Central and KIE Server are running on different instances, then the JAAS login module is triggered for both individually. Therefore, a user who is authenticated for Business Central must be authenticated separately to access KIE Server.  For example, if a user who is authenticated on Business Central but not authenticated on KIE Server tries to view or manage process definitions in Business Central, a 401 error is logged in the log file and the <literal>Invalid credentials to load data from remote server. Contact your system administrator.</literal> message appears in Business Central.</simpara>
<simpara>This section describes Red Hat Process Automation Manager user roles.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>admin</literal>,  <literal>analyst</literal>,
<literal>developer</literal>, <literal>manager</literal>, <literal>process-admin</literal>, <literal>user</literal>,
 and <literal>rest-all</literal> roles are reserved for Business Central. The <literal>kie-server</literal> role is reserved for KIE Server. For this reason, the available roles can differ depending on whether Business Central, KIE Server, or both are installed.</simpara>
</note>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>admin</literal>: Users with the <literal>admin</literal> role are the Business Central administrators. They can manage users and create, clone, and manage repositories. They have full access to make required changes in the application. Users with the <literal>admin</literal> role have access to all areas within Red Hat Process Automation Manager.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>analyst</literal>: Users with the <literal>analyst</literal> role have access to all high-level features. They can model
and execute their
projects. However, these users cannot add contributors to spaces or delete spaces in the <emphasis role="strong">Design → Projects</emphasis> view. Access to the <emphasis role="strong">Deploy → Execution Servers</emphasis> view, which is intended for administrators, is not available to users with the <literal>analyst</literal> role. However, the <emphasis role="strong">Deploy</emphasis> button is available to these users when they access the Library perspective.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>developer</literal>: Users with the <literal>developer</literal> role have access to almost all features and can manage rules, models, process flows, forms, and dashboards. They can manage the asset repository, they can create, build, and deploy projects, and they can use Red Hat CodeReady Studio to view processes. Only certain administrative functions such as creating and cloning a new repository are hidden from users with the <literal>developer</literal> role.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>manager</literal>: Users with the <literal>manager</literal> role can view reports. These users are usually interested in statistics about the business processes and their performance, business indicators, and other business-related reporting. A user with this role has access only to process and task reports.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>process-admin</literal>: Users with the <literal>process-admin</literal> role are business process administrators. They have full access to business processes, business tasks, and execution errors. These users can also view business reports and have access to the Task Inbox list.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>user</literal>: Users with the <literal>user</literal> role can work on the Task Inbox list, which contains business tasks that are part of currently running processes. Users with this role can view process and task reports and manage processes.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>rest-all</literal>: Users with the <literal>rest-all</literal> role can access Business Central REST capabilities.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>kie-server</literal>: Users with the <literal>kie-server</literal> role can access KIE Server REST capabilities.

<title>Securing passwords with a keystore</title>
<simpara>You can use a keystore to encrypt passwords that are used for communication between Business Central and KIE Server. You should encrypt both controller and KIE Server passwords. If Business Central and KIE Server are deployed to different application servers, then both application servers should use the keystore.</simpara>
<simpara>Use Java Cryptography Extension KeyStore (JCEKS) for your keystore because it supports symmetric keys. Use KeyTool, which is part of the JDK installation, to create a new JCEKS.</simpara>

<title>KIE Server data sets on Dashbuilder Runtime</title>
<simpara>A data set is a collection of related information. If you have a KIE Server that contains imported data sets, you can use Dashbuilder Runtime and the KIE Server REST API to run queries on imported data sets.</simpara>
<simpara>Because KIE Server uses Business Central as a controller, KIE Server containers are created in Business Central. Data sets are also created in Business Central. The KIE Server configuration is a template that you can refer to when you create data sets or install containers.</simpara>
<simpara>Other services, such as Dashbuilder Runtime, use the KIE Server REST API to retrieve KIE Server information. Dashbuilder Runtime accesses the KIE Server REST API to run queries from data sets.</simpara>
<simpara>When a KIE Server data set is created in Business Central, the server template information is provided and it is used by Dashbuilder Runtime to look for the KIE Server information. For example:</simpara>
<screen>dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.location={LOCATION}
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.user={USER}
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.password={PASSWORD}
dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.token={TOKEN}</screen>
<simpara>You can also setup KIE Server for each  data set. For example:</simpara>
<screen>dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.location={LOCATION}
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.user={USER}
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.password={PASSWORD}
dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.token={TOKEN}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Token authentication is not used if credentials are provided.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>You might want to run the dashboard against another KIE Server installation. When data sets are created on a KIE Server in a development environment, the data sets queries are created on the development KIE Server, for example DEV. If the dashboards are exported to a production environment, for example PROD, with a different KIE Server, the queries that you created in DEV are not available, so an error is thrown. In this case it is possible to port queries from  a data set to another KIE Server by using the replace query functionality, either through a server template or a data set:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Server template example:</simpara>
<screen>dashbuilder.kieserver.serverTemplate.{SERVER_TEMPLATE}.replace_query=true</screen>

<screen>dashbuilder.kieserver.dataset.{DATA_SET_NAME}.replace_query=true</screen>

<simpara>When a dashboard is uploaded it is stored in the filesystem. The path where it is stored is controlled by the system property <literal>dashbuilder.import.base.dir</literal>. The default is <literal>/tmp/dashbuilder</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The system property is the root path for any dashboard model. For example, if there are multiple files on this path, the file can be imported by accessing Dashbuilder Runtime and passing a query parameter import with the name of the file that should be loaded. For example, if you want to load the <literal>sales_dashboard</literal>, execute <literal>runtime_host?import=sales_dashboard</literal> and Dashbuilder Runtime will try to load the file <literal>/tmp/dashbuilder/sales_dashboard.zip</literal>.</simpara>

<term>Static Dashboard</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you want the runtime instance to load a specific dashboard, you can change the system property <literal>dashbuilder.runtime.import</literal>. Setting the property to a local file path will cause that specific dashboard to be loaded during Runtime startup.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Controlling upload size</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Application servers control POST request size by default. You can control the allowable size of uploaded dashboards by using the system property <literal>dashbuilder.runtime.upload.size</literal>. The size should be in KB and by default the value is 96kb, meaning that if someone tries to upload a file larger than 96kb then an error will be displayed and the dashboard won’t be installed.</simpara>

<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager clusters</title>
<simpara>By clustering two or more computers, you have the benefits of high availability, enhanced collaboration, and load balancing. High availability decreases the chance of data loss when a single computer fails. When a computer fails, another computer fills the gap by providing a copy of the data that was on the failed computer. When the failed computer comes online again, it resumes its place in the cluster.</simpara>
<simpara>There are several ways that you can cluster Red Hat Process Automation Manager components. This document describes how to cluster the following scenarios:</simpara>

<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager clusters in a development (authoring) environment</title>
<simpara>Developers can use Red Hat Process Automation Manager to author rules and processes that assist users with decision making.</simpara>
<simpara>You can configure Red Hat Process Automation Manager as a clustered development environment to benefit from high availability. With a clustered environment, if a developer is working on a node and that node fails, that developer’s work is preserved and visible on any other node of the cluster.</simpara>
<simpara>Most development environments consist of Business Central
for creating rules and processes.
 and at least one KIE Server
 to test those rules and processes

<simpara>Red Hat Data Grid is built from the Infinispan open-source software project. It is a distributed in-memory key/value data store that has indexing capabilities that enable you to store, search, and analyze high volumes of data quickly and in near-real time. In a Red Hat Process Automation Manager clustered environment, it enables you to perform complex and efficient searches across cluster nodes.</simpara>
<simpara>A JMS broker is a software component that receives messages, stores them locally, and forwards the messages to a recipient. AMQ Broker enables your applications to communicate with any messaging provider. It specifies how components such as message-driven beans, Enterprise JavaBeans, and servlets can send or receive messages.</simpara>

<title>KIE Server clusters in a runtime environment</title>
<simpara>In a runtime environment, KIE Server runs services that contain rules and processes that support business decisions.
The primary benefit of clustering a KIE Server runtime environment is load balancing. If activity on one node of the cluster increases, that activity can be shared among the other nodes of the cluster to improve performance.</simpara>
<simpara>To create a KIE Server clustered runtime environment, you download and extract Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.3 and KIE Server. Then, you configure Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.3 for a cluster, start the cluster, and install KIE Server on each cluster node.</simpara>
<simpara>Optionally, you can then cluster the headless Process Automation Manager controller and Smart Router.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Do not connect KIE Server to Business Central in high availability (HA) on premise environments.</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central instances are not able to keep in sync with the status of each  KIE Server. For example, if a KIE Server is up but not in sync, Business Central will not be able to deploy through that instance.</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>You can enter any name for the value of the <literal>partition</literal> property. However, a node will only see timers from other nodes that have the same partition name. Grouping nodes into partitions by assigning partition names enables you to break a large cluster up into several smaller clusters. Doing this improves performance. For example, instead of having a cluster of 100 nodes, where all 100 nodes are trying to execute and refresh the same timers, you can create 20 clusters of 5 nodes by giving every group of 5 a different partition name.</simpara>

<title>Installing and configuring Smart Router</title>
<simpara>Smart Router (KIE Server router) is a lightweight Java component that you can use as an integration layer between multiple KIE Servers, client applications, and other components. Depending on your deployment and execution environment, Smart Router can aggregate multiple independent KIE Server instances as though they are a single server. Smart Router provides the following features:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Data aggregation</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Collects data from all KIE Server instances (one instance from each group) when there is a client application request and aggregates the results in a single response.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Routing</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Functions as a single endpoint that receives calls from client applications to any of your services and routes each call automatically to the KIE Server that runs the specific service. This means that KIE Servers do not need to have the same services deployed.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Load balancing</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Provides efficient load balancing. Load balancing requests for a Smart Router cluster must be managed externally with standard load balancing tools.</simpara>

<title>Clustering KIE Servers with Smart Router</title>
<simpara>You can use Smart Router to aggregate multiple independent KIE Server instances as though they are a single server. It performs the role of an intelligent load balancer because it can route requests to individual KIE Servers and aggregate data from different KIE Servers. Smart Router uses aliases to perform as a proxy.</simpara>

<note>
<simpara>You do not need to configure KIE Server as unmanaged for Smart Router.</simpara>
<simpara>An unmanaged KIE Server does not connect to the controller.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, if you connect an unmanaged KIE Server to Smart Router and register Smart Router with the controller, then Business Central contacts the unmanaged KIE Server by using Smart Router.</simpara>

<title>Configuring Smart Router behavior</title>
<simpara>In a clustered environment with multiple KIE Servers, the default behavior is to send requests to each KIE Server in parallel and a host of each KIE Server is sent the request using the "round-robin" method. In the following example environment, each KIE Server is deployed with the same KJAR but each KJAR version is different:</simpara>

<simpara>If you send a request, the request is sent to <literal>kie-server1 (129.0.1.2)</literal>, <literal>kie-server2 (129.0.2.3)</literal>, and <literal>kie-server3 (129.0.3.1)</literal>.</simpara>

<simpara>Smart Router has three components that you can modify to change this behavior:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>ContainerResolver</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The component responsible for finding the container id to use when interacting with servers.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>RestrictionPolicy</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The component responsible for disallowing Smart Router to use specific endpoints.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>ConfigRepository</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The component responsible for maintaining the Smart Router configuration. This is mainly related to the routing table.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>IdentityService</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>The component responsible for allowing you to use your own identity provider. This is for KIE Server instances.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>Smart Router uses the <literal>ServiceLoader</literal> utility to implement these components:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>ContainerResolver</term>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>META-INF/services/org.kie.server.router.spi.ContainerResolver</literal></simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara><literal>META-INF/services/org.kie.server.router.identity.IdentityService</literal></simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>For example, for the above scenario, you can customize the <literal>ContainerResolver</literal> to make Smart Router search for the latest version of the KJAR process across all available KIE Servers and to always start with that process. This scenario would mean that each KIE Server hosts a single KJAR and each version will share the same alias.</simpara>
<simpara>Since Smart Router is an executable jar, to include extensions, you need to modify the command. For example:</simpara>
<screen>java -cp LOCATION/router-ext-7.9.0.redhat-00002.jar:rhpam-7.9.0-smart-router.jar org.kie.server.router.KieServerRouter</screen>
<simpara>Once the service is started you will see log output stating the implementation that is used for the components:</simpara>

<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager components</title>
<simpara>Red Hat Process Automation Manager is made up of Business Central and KIE Server.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Business Central is the graphical user interface where you create and manage business rules. You can install Business Central in a Red Hat JBoss EAP instance or on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OpenShift).</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central is also available as a standalone JAR file. You can use the Business Central standalone JAR file to run Business Central without deploying it to an application server.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>KIE Server is the server where rules and other artifacts are executed. It is used to instantiate and execute rules and solve planning problems. You can install KIE Server in a Red Hat JBoss EAP instance, in a Red Hat JBoss EAP cluster, on OpenShift, in an Oracle WebLogic server instance, in an IBM WebSphere Application Server instance, or as a part of Spring Boot application.</simpara>
<simpara>You can configure KIE Server to run in managed or unmanaged mode. If KIE Server is unmanaged, you must manually create and maintain KIE containers (deployment units). A KIE container is a specific version of a project. If KIE Server is managed, the Process Automation Manager controller manages the KIE Server configuration and you interact with the Process Automation Manager controller to create and maintain KIE containers.</simpara>
<simpara>On a Red Hat JBoss Web Server installation, you can install KIE Server and the headless Process Automation Manager controller. Alternatively, you can run the standalone Business Central JAR file.</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section xml:id="roles-users-con_install-on-jws">
<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager roles and users</title>
<simpara>To access Business Central or KIE Server, you must create users and assign them appropriate roles before the servers are started. You can create users and roles when you install Business Central or KIE Server.</simpara>
<simpara>Business Central and KIE Server use the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login module to authenticate users. If both Business Central and KIE Server are running on a single instance, then they share the same JAAS subject and security domain. Therefore, a user who is authenticated for Business Central can also access KIE Server.</simpara>
<simpara>However, if Business Central and KIE Server are running on different instances, then the JAAS login module is triggered for both individually. Therefore, a user who is authenticated for Business Central must be authenticated separately to access KIE Server.  For example, if a user who is authenticated on Business Central but not authenticated on KIE Server tries to view or manage process definitions in Business Central, a 401 error is logged in the log file and the <literal>Invalid credentials to load data from remote server. Contact your system administrator.</literal> message appears in Business Central.</simpara>
<simpara>This section describes Red Hat Process Automation Manager user roles.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>The <literal>admin</literal>,  <literal>analyst</literal>,
<literal>developer</literal>, <literal>manager</literal>, <literal>process-admin</literal>, <literal>user</literal>,
 and <literal>rest-all</literal> roles are reserved for Business Central. The <literal>kie-server</literal> role is reserved for KIE Server. For this reason, the available roles can differ depending on whether Business Central, KIE Server, or both are installed.</simpara>

Only certain administrative functions such as creating and cloning a new repository are hidden from users with the <literal>developer</literal> role.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>manager</literal>: Users with the <literal>manager</literal> role can view reports. These users are usually interested in statistics about the business processes and their performance, business indicators, and other business-related reporting. A user with this role has access only to process and task reports.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>process-admin</literal>: Users with the <literal>process-admin</literal> role are business process administrators.

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>user</literal>: Users with the <literal>user</literal> role can work on the Task Inbox list, which contains business tasks that are part of currently running processes. Users with this role can view process and task reports and manage processes.</simpara>

<title>KIE Server</title>
<simpara>KIE Server is the server where the rules and other artifacts for Red Hat Process Automation Manager are stored and run. KIE Server is a standalone built-in component that can be used to instantiate and execute rules through interfaces available for REST, Java Message Service (JMS), or Java client-side applications,
as well as to manage processes, jobs,
and Red Hat Business Optimizer functionality through solvers.</simpara>
<simpara>Created as a web deployable WAR file, KIE Server can be deployed on any web container. The current version of the KIE Server is included with default extensions for both Red Hat Decision Manager and Red Hat Process Automation Manager.</simpara>
<simpara>KIE Server has a low footprint with minimal memory consumption and therefore can be deployed easily on a cloud instance. Each instance of this server can open and instantiate multiple containers, which enables you to execute multiple rule services in parallel.</simpara>
<simpara>KIE Server can be integrated with other application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server or IBM WebSphere Application Server, to streamline Red Hat Process Automation Manager application management.</simpara>

<title>Configuring an embedded process engine and decision engine in IBM WebSphere Application Server</title>
<simpara>An embedded engine is a light-weight workflow and rule engine that enables you to execute your decisions and business processes. An embedded engine can be part of a Red Hat Process Automation Manager application or it can be deployed as a service through OpenShift, Kubernetes, and Docker. You can embed an engine in a Red Hat Process Automation Manager application through the API or as a set of contexts and dependency injection (CDI) services.</simpara>
<simpara>If you intend to use an embedded engine with your Red Hat Process Automation Manager application, you must add Maven dependencies to your project by adding the Red Hat Business Automation bill of materials (BOM) files to the project’s <literal>pom.xml</literal> file. The Red Hat Business Automation BOM applies to both Red Hat Decision Manager and Red Hat Process Automation Manager. For more information about the Red Hat Business Automation BOM, see <link xlink:href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3405361">What is the mapping between Red Hat Process Automation Manager and the Maven library version?</link>.</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<title>Procedure</title>
<listitem>
<simpara>Declare the Red Hat Business Automation BOM in the <literal>pom.xml</literal> file:</simpara>

&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
&lt;dependencies&gt;
&lt;!-- Your dependencies --&gt;

</informalexample>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Declare dependencies required for your project in the <literal>&lt;dependencies&gt;</literal> tag.

However, you must use the <literal>&lt;dependency&gt;</literal> element to declare dependencies which you want to use in your project.</simpara>

<title>KIE Server</title>
<simpara>KIE Server is the server where the rules and other artifacts for Red Hat Process Automation Manager are stored and run. KIE Server is a standalone built-in component that can be used to instantiate and execute rules through interfaces available for REST, Java Message Service (JMS), or Java client-side applications,
as well as to manage processes, jobs,
and Red Hat Business Optimizer functionality through solvers.</simpara>
<simpara>Created as a web deployable WAR file, KIE Server can be deployed on any web container. The current version of the KIE Server is included with default extensions for both Red Hat Decision Manager and Red Hat Process Automation Manager.</simpara>
<simpara>KIE Server has a low footprint with minimal memory consumption and therefore can be deployed easily on a cloud instance. Each instance of this server can open and instantiate multiple containers, which enables you to execute multiple rule services in parallel.</simpara>
<simpara>KIE Server can be integrated with other application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server or IBM WebSphere Application Server, to streamline Red Hat Process Automation Manager application management.</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="wls-configure-embedded-engine-proc">
<title>Configuring an embedded process engine and decision engine in Oracle WebLogic Server</title>
<simpara>An embedded engine is a light-weight workflow and rule engine that enables you to execute your decisions and business processes. An embedded engine can be part of a Red Hat Process Automation Manager application or it can be deployed as a service through OpenShift, Kubernetes, and Docker. You can embed an engine in a Red Hat Process Automation Manager application through the API or as a set of contexts and dependency injection (CDI) services.</simpara>
<simpara>If you intend to use an embedded engine with your Red Hat Process Automation Manager application, you must add Maven dependencies to your project by adding the Red Hat Business Automation bill of materials (BOM) files to the project’s <literal>pom.xml</literal> file. The Red Hat Business Automation BOM applies to both Red Hat Decision Manager and Red Hat Process Automation Manager. For more information about the Red Hat Business Automation BOM, see <link xlink:href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3405361">What is the mapping between Red Hat Process Automation Manager and the Maven library version?</link>.</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<title>Procedure</title>
<listitem>
<simpara>Declare the Red Hat Business Automation BOM in the <literal>pom.xml</literal> file:</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Declare dependencies required for your project in the <literal>&lt;dependencies&gt;</literal> tag. After you import the product BOM into your project, the versions of the user-facing product dependencies are defined so you do not need to specify the <literal>&lt;version&gt;</literal> sub-element of these <literal>&lt;dependency&gt;</literal> elements.

<title>Red Hat Process Automation Manager versioning</title>
<simpara>Red Hat Process Automation Manager versions are designated with a numerical <literal>Major.Minor.Patch</literal> format, such as <literal>7.7.1</literal>. In this example, the major release is <literal>7.x.x</literal>, the minor release is <literal>7.7.x</literal>, and the patch release is <literal>7.7.1</literal>. Major releases often require data migration, while minor release upgrades and patch updates are typically managed with update tools provided with the Red Hat Process Automation Manager release artifacts.</simpara>
<simpara>The following are the general types of releases for Red Hat Process Automation Manager:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Major release migrations</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Major releases of Red Hat Process Automation Manager include substantial enhancements, security updates, bug fixes, and possibly redesigned features and functions. Data migration is typically required when an application is moved from one major release to another major release, such as from Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.x to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.0. Automated migration tools are often provided with new major versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate migration, but some manual effort is likely required for certain data and configurations. The supported migration paths are specified in product announcements and documentation.</simpara>
<simpara>For example migration instructions, see
<link xlink:href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_process_automation_manager/7.0/html/migrating_from_red_hat_jboss_bpm_suite_6.4_to_red_hat_process_automation_manager_7.0/"><emphasis>Migrating from Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4 to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.0</emphasis></link>.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Minor release upgrades</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Minor releases of Red Hat Process Automation Manager include enhancements, security updates, and bug fixes. Data migration may be required when an application is moved from one minor release to another minor release, such as from Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7.x to 7.8. Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate updating certain components of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless Process Automation Manager controller. Other Red Hat Process Automation Manager artifacts, such as the decision engine and standalone Business Central, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must re-install them to apply the update.</simpara>
<simpara>Before you upgrade to a new minor release, apply the latest patch update to your current version of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to ensure that the minor release upgrade is successful.</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Patch updates</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>Patch updates of Red Hat Process Automation Manager include the latest security updates and bug fixes. Scheduled patch updates contain all previously released patch updates for that minor version of the product, so you do not need to apply each patch update incrementally in order to apply the latest update. For example, you can update Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7.0 or 7.7.1 to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7.2. However, for optimal Red Hat Process Automation Manager performance, apply product updates as they become available. Occasionally, unscheduled patch updates may be released outside the normal update cycle of the existing product. These may include security or other updates provided by Red Hat Global Support Services (GSS) to fix specific issues, and may not be cumulative updates.</simpara>
<simpara>Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate updating certain components of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless Process Automation Manager controller.

<title>Applying patch updates and minor release upgrades to Red Hat Process Automation Manager</title>
<simpara>Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of Red Hat Process Automation Manager to facilitate updating certain components of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless Process Automation Manager controller. Other Red Hat Process Automation Manager artifacts, such as the decision engine and standalone Business Central, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must re-install them to apply the update.</simpara>
<simpara>You can use the same automated update tool to apply both patch updates and minor release upgrades to Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.10. Patch updates of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as an update from version 7.10 to 7.10.1, include the latest security updates and bug fixes. Minor release upgrades of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as an upgrade from version 7.8.x to 7.9, include enhancements, security updates, and bug fixes.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Only updates for Red Hat Process Automation Manager are included in Red Hat Process Automation Manager update tools. Updates to Red Hat JBoss EAP must be applied using Red Hat JBoss EAP patch distributions.

<title>Procedure</title>
<listitem>
<simpara>Navigate to the <link xlink:href="https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html">Software Downloads</link> page in the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required), and select the product and version from the drop-down options.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are upgrading to a new minor release of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as an upgrade from version 7.8.x to 7.9, first apply the latest patch update to your current version of Red Hat Process Automation Manager and then follow this procedure again to upgrade to the new minor release.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Click <emphasis role="strong">Patches</emphasis>, download the <emphasis role="strong">Red Hat Process Automation Manager [VERSION] Update Tool</emphasis>, and extract the downloaded <literal>rhpam-$VERSION-update.zip</literal> file to a temporary directory.</simpara>
<simpara>This update tool automates the update of certain components of Red Hat Process Automation Manager, such as Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless Process Automation Manager controller. Use this update tool first to apply updates and then install any other updates or new release artifacts that are relevant to your Red Hat Process Automation Manager distribution.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you want to preserve any files from being updated by the update tool, navigate to the extracted <literal>rhpam-$VERSION-update</literal> folder, open the <literal>blacklist.txt</literal> file, and add the relative paths to the files that you do not want to be updated.</simpara>
<simpara>When a file is listed in the <literal>blacklist.txt</literal> file, the update script does not replace the file with the new version but instead leaves the file in place and in the same location adds the new version with a <literal>.new</literal> suffix. If you blacklist files that are no longer being distributed, the update tool creates an empty marker file with a <literal>.removed</literal> suffix. You can then choose to retain, merge, or delete these new files manually.</simpara>
<simpara>Example files to be excluded in <literal>blacklist.txt</literal> file:</simpara>
<screen>WEB-INF/web.xml  // Custom file
styles/base.css  // Obsolete custom file kept for record</screen>
<simpara>The contents of the blacklisted file directories after the update:</simpara>
<screen>$ ls WEB-INF
web.xml web.xml.new</screen>
<screen>$ ls styles
base.css base.css.removed</screen>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>In your command terminal, navigate to the temporary directory where you extracted the <literal>rhpam-$VERSION-update.zip</literal> file and run the <literal>apply-updates</literal> script in the following format:</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Make sure that your Red Hat Process Automation Manager and KIE Server instances are not running before you apply updates. Do not apply updates while you are running an instance of Red Hat Process Automation Manager or KIE Server.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>On Linux or Unix-based systems:</simpara>
<screen>$ ./apply-updates.sh $DISTRO_PATH $DISTRO_TYPE</screen>
<simpara>On Windows:</simpara>
<screen>$ .\apply-updates.bat $DISTRO_PATH $DISTRO_TYPE</screen>
<simpara>The <literal>$DISTRO_PATH</literal> portion is the path to the relevant distribution directory and the <literal>$DISTRO_TYPE</literal> portion is the type of distribution that you are updating with this update.</simpara>

<simpara>If you use the standalone <emphasis role="strong">Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.10.0 Maven Repository</emphasis> artifact (<literal>rhpam-7.10.0-maven-repository.zip</literal>), such as in air-gap environments, download <emphasis role="strong">Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.10.x Maven Repository</emphasis> and extract the downloaded <literal>rhpam-7.10.x-maven-repository.zip</literal> file to your existing <literal>~/maven-repository</literal> directory to update the relevant contents.</simpara>
<simpara>Example Maven repository update:</simpara>
<screen>$ extract -o rhpam-7.10.x-maven-repository.zip 'rhba-7.10.1.GA-maven-repository/maven-repository/*' -d /tmp/rhbaMavenRepoUpdate

$ mv /tmp/rhbaMavenRepoUpdate/rhba-7.10.0.GA-maven-repository/maven-repository/ $REPO_PATH/</screen>
<note>
<simpara>You can remove the <literal>/tmp/rhbaMavenRepoUpdate</literal> folder after you complete the update.</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>After you finish applying all relevant updates, start Red Hat Process Automation Manager and KIE Server and log in to Business Central.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Verify that all project data is present and accurate in Business Central, and in the top-right corner of the Business Central window, click your profile name and click <emphasis role="strong">About</emphasis> to verify the updated product version number.</simpara>
